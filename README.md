Silly Space Game

I'm making a Silly Space Game to put in my blog as an example.

The purpose is to show how easy is to make a game using the awesome <a href="http://haxeflixel.com">HaxeFlixel</a>.

I never used GitHub, so enjoy this mess! ( :


The Game: http://droidalex.github.io/SSG/

Things can be done in this or your own Game:

- Improve the code.
- More enemies especies
- Bonus stage every 'n' stages.
- More guns
- Boss stages
- Cool effects & explosions
- Create Enemies.hx & Player.hx extending FlxSprite classes.
- etc.
